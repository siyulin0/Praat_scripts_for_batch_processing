Ensure that the sampling frequency of your target sound file matches the sampling frequency of the silence file you create. You can adjust the silence fileâ€™s sampling frequency directly in the script.

The scripts are configured by default to process files in .wav format. If your target files use a different format, you can update the default setting in the script to match your preferred format.
